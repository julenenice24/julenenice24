Hey there, I'm Arnold Jaoko
I'm a Cybersecurity Engineering Student with hands-on experience in
Python, JavaScript, Linux basics and security/networkingtools. I also
have experience in the data analysis field where I leveraged  using
skils like data visualisation, data mining, data cleaning which I
used to deliver actionable insights, and support informed decisionmaking.
